		<p>Faster than a speeding bullet. More powerful than a locomotive. 
			Able to leap tall buildings at a single bound. Look! Up in the sky. 
			It's a bird. It's a plane. It's Superman! 
			Yes, it's Superman - strange visitor from another planet 
			who came to Earth with powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men.
			Superman - who can change the course of mighty rivers, 
			bend steel in his bare hands, and who disguised as Clark Kent,
			mild-mannered reporter for a great metropolitan newspaper, 
			fights a neverending battle for Truth, Justice, and the American Way.</p>
